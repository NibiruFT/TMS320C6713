The TI’s [TMS320C6713 DSP Starter Kit](https://www.ti.com/tool/TMDSDSK6713?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=epd-pro-null-44700045336317896_prodfolderdynamic-cpc-pf-google-wwe_int&utm_content=prodfolddynamic&ds_k=DYNAMIC+SEARCH+ADS&DCM=yes&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiYOxBhC5ARIsAIvdH53n28aNCoVE2ZOj320liwUfzcW4QVjyPzdt2Vdv1RH4B3XFc7M_Uw0aAtKNEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) (DSK), developed jointly with Spectrum Digital, is a low-cost development platform designed to speed the development of high precision applications based on TI´s TMS320C6000 floating point DSP generation. It is designed and optimized to perform digital signal processing operations. 

The DSK comes with a full compliment of [on-board devices](https://image.slideserve.com/745747/tms320c6713-dsk-block-diagram-l.jpg) that suit a wide variety of application environments.

## Code Composer Studio
The [Code Composer Studio](https://community.element14.com/products/devtools/technicallibrary/w/documents/9304/texas-instruments-code-composer-studio-ccstudio-ide-overview) (CCS) is an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports TI's Microcontroller and Embedded Processors portfolio.

> Installation: This project was made with the original version CCS v3.1. All the content included in the [CD](https://5.imimg.com/data5/SELLER/Default/2023/2/BF/PQ/IG/139567121/dsp-starter-kit-dsk-starter-kit-tms320c6713.png) and its installation process can be found [here](https://github.com/NibiruFT/TMS320C6713/tree/main/Installation).
>
> ⚠️ The CCS IDE have a lot of [newer versions](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/CCSTUDIO), however, many of them encounter [compatibility issues](https://e2e.ti.com/support/tools/code-composer-studio-group/ccs/f/code-composer-studio-forum/260934/compatibility-ccs-with-tms320c6713-dsk-kit) with TMS320C6713.

## Digital Signal Processing and Applications with the C6713 and C6416 DSK

[DSP C6713 by Rulph Chassaing](http://firasaboulatif.free.fr/index_files/gaidaa%20book/Digital%20Signal%20Processing/Wiley%20-%20Digital%20Signal%20Processing%20and%20Applications%20with%20the%20C6713%20and%20C6416%20DSK.pdf) is a tutorial book on digital techniques for waveform generation, digital filters, and digital signal processing tools and techniques. The typical chapter begins with some theoretical material followed by working examples and experiments using the TMS320C6713-based DSPStarter Kit (DSK).

> This book have an accompanying CD-ROM that contains all the programs discussed in the book. Examples files attached in the CD-ROM can be found [here](https://github.com/NibiruFT/TMS320C6713/tree/main/DSP%20C6713%20(Rulph%20Chassaing)).
