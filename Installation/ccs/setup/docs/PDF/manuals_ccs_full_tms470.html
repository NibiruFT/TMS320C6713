<H3>Tips for Finding Documents and Related Information</H3>
<P>The list of documents on this page are PDF files found locally in your 
documentation directory (usually at <STRONG>C:\CCStudio\docs\pdf</STRONG> ). If 
for some reason, a link calls up an error message, it may be because the PDF 
file is not there or mislabeled. You have two options: 
<OL>
  <LI>copy the PDF file from the install CD (i.e., 
  <STRONG>C:\CCSTudio\docs\pdf</STRONG>). 
  <LI>go to the <A 
  href="http://www.dspvillage.com/">http://www.dspvillage.com/</A> and enter 
  your search term in the Keyword field on the top right corner of the page. 
  Entering the document number (i.e., <EM>SPRA601</EM> ) tends to bring the most 
  accurate results, although if that fails, you may need to enter the Title or 
  keywords. Many PDF document have alphabet letters to indicate versions. So 
  SPRU018D is more recent than SPRU018C. </LI></OL>
<P>If you're not sure what document you need and just want to browse through a 
list, you can find on the ti.com site a <A 
href="http://www.ti.com/sc/docs/psheets/manuals.htm">list of online manuals</A>. 
</P>
<p>Adobe Acrobat Reader 6.0 includes several features to improve the overall reading experience for longer documents(including  better search and indexing capability). If you haven't upgraded already, you should do so.
</p>
<P>Many of the PDF's linked on this page are lengthy, so it's quite 
possible that the document encompasses many more topics than the title would 
suggest. If you're looking for a specific keyword (like a function or plugin 
tool), you can also click the <EM>Index</EM> or <EM>Search</EM> tab on the left 
side of this help window. Often this can be the fastest way to find the 
information you need. </P>
<P>Finally, TI now has a <A 
href="http://www-k.ext.ti.com/sc/technical-support/dsp-kbase">searchable DSP 
knowledgebase </A>which often contains the most up-to-date information about 
potential bugs and workarounds. Because the number of results may sometimes be 
unwieldy, it's often helpful to filter results. For example, changing the 
<STRONG>Document Type</STRONG> to "<EM>Frequently Asked Questions</EM>" will 
exclude PDF's and show only questions and answers entered by support engineers. 
If you have a general question about Code Composer Studio, you can narrow your 
search by choosing the right DSP Platform (C5000, C6000, etc) but leaving the 
default "<EM>Not answered</EM>" for <STRONG>Tool Type</STRONG>. At the time of 
this writing, search results are NOT organized chronologically, so you may need 
to be careful that what you are reading is in fact the most recent document. If 
you simply wish to browse through all of the most recent user guides, you can go 
<A href="http://www.ti.com/sc/docs/psheets/manuals.htm">here</A> </P>
